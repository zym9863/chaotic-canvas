# Chaotic Canvas

[中文](README.md) | [English](README_EN.md)

A creative drawing application filled with randomness and chaotic elements, making your artistic creation full of surprises and unpredictability.

## Project Introduction

Chaotic Canvas is an interactive drawing application based on HTML5 Canvas, which differs from traditional drawing tools by incorporating a large amount of randomness and chaotic elements, making each creation full of surprises. When you draw on the canvas, various random interferences and special effects will appear, making your creative process more interesting and unpredictable.

## Features

### Special Brushes

- **Random Color Brush**: Randomly changes colors while drawing, creating rich and colorful lines
- **Zigzag Brush**: Produces wavy, zigzag lines, adding dynamism to your drawing
- **Splatter Brush**: Creates splatter effects while drawing the main line, simulating a spray feeling
- **Ghost Brush**: Creates semi-transparent gradient effects, floating unpredictably like a ghost

### Chaotic Interference Elements

Based on the set chaos level, the application will randomly trigger the following interference effects:

- **Canvas Shake**: The canvas suddenly shakes, simulating an unstable drawing surface
- **Color Bleeding**: Random color bleeding effects appear on the canvas
- **Random Shapes**: Random geometric shapes suddenly appear on the canvas
- **Autonomous Drawing**: The canvas automatically generates random lines, as if an invisible hand is drawing

### Adjustable Parameters

- **Brush Size**: Adjust the thickness of the brush
- **Chaos Level**: Control the frequency and intensity of random interference; the higher the value, the more chaotic the canvas

## User Guide

1. Choose your preferred brush type
2. Adjust brush size and chaos level
3. Create freely on the canvas
4. Experience the surprises brought by random interference
5. To clear the canvas, click the "Clear Canvas" button (requires confirmation)
